---

There was a blue hedgehog and a snail. One day, they decided to have a race.

Waiting at the starting line, they did some stretching, and then counted down.

Three, two, one, go!

With a sudden jolt, the hedgehog moved up ahead.
The snail was lagging behind, but the it caught up to the hedgehog and overtook him.
The hedgehog noticed the snail's advance. So the hedgehog rolled up, and became fast. He was soon ahead again.
However, snail's pace is nothing to sneeze at. The snail caught up to the hedgehog soon, and just like that, they were racing ahead and behind, back and fourth, over and over.
The end line was in sight. The hedgehog used his last remaining strengh to overtake the snail at the final moment.

The hedgehog won!

It was a close one.
