There were three men and a tophat. These men were magicians, so they could make rabbits come out of the tophat.

The first man picked up the hat, and out of the hat came a rabbit.

The second man picked up the hat, and pulled out another rabbit.

The third man picked up the hat, and yet another rabbit popped out of the hat.

The first man asked the first rabbit,
"I want to be rich and famous."

The rabbit said,
"Sure."

The second man asked the second rabbit,
"I want a beautiful and kindhearted woman."

And the rabbit said,
"Sure."

The third man asked the third rabbit,
"I want you to say, 'sure'."

And the rabbit said,
"Sure."
